              <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>    
              <p>
                  I tried meditation before I start studying.
              </p>
          
              <h3>what did you find interesting?</h3>    
              <p>
                 It was interesting that meditation is very good in many different ways
                 and it is scientifically approved. Also, the way to create habits such
                 as 'behaviour first and then attitude' were 
                 interesting too.
              </p>
          
              <h3>what worked for you?</h3>    
              <p>
                  I found meditation improved my concentration on study and 
                  made me easy to control my emotions.
              </p>
          
              <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>    
              <p>
                  I want to try to make some good habits and try the Pomodoro
                  time management technique.
