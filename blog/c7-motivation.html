                <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
                <p>
                    Pleasure is happyness that comes from happy moment but it is hard to maintain,
                     passion comes where you feel your are involved and work performance meets your ability,
                      and highger purpose is like dream. 
                     People tends to find pleasure more in their lives but happiness coming
                      from the pleasure is not very sustainable. Hence for sustainable happiness, 
                      people should focus on highter purpose, sometimes enjoying flow and then look 
                      for pleasure.
                </p>

                <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, <br>
                    What are your core values?<br>
                    What do you stand for?</h3>
                <p>
                    I think my core values are honesty, creativity and kindness. I want to be honest 
                    and kind to others all the time, and I like making something.
                     And I'm not sure what exactly 'to stand for' means. If it means 'to support'(I googled),
                     I support conservation of environment and animal welfare.
                </p>

                <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
                <p>
                    I felt resilience is what I need as I get lost my mind with strong emotions sometimes.
                    I read it with interest. To be honest, I thought it explains the same thing when it 
                    was about meditation and mindfulness. I am trying to meditate everyday and focus 
                    on my breath in daily life. I think it helps managing my emotions and studying.                    
                </p>

                <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
                <p>
                    The story about Roz Savage, who is the first women to complete the Atlantic Rowing Race 
                    solo, was very impressive. She was just a normal worker at a bank before she left everything
                    for her new future and started rowing the oceans. These days I get tired easily and 
                    feel like I just want to live a easy life, but I thought about my life again after 
                    reading this.
