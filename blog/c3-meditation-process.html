                <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
                <p>
                    I thought meditation helps people to control feelings and 
                    emotions by clearing their mind and enhance concentration.

                </p>
                <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
                <p>
                    Meditation is mental training that can be done by focusing 
                    on breathing and gaining attention. It enhances mental health 
                    and happiness. It gives detailed instruction about the right posture 
                    which needs to be both alert and relaxed and how to meditate properly. 
                    That was different what I thought and was interesting.  
                </p>
                <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
                <p>
                    I found how to deal with distractions are pretty interesting because 
                    When I meditate I always tried hard to get rid of distractions. 
                    but it said 'experience without judging' and 'gently inviting it to 
                    stop distracting'.
                    Also I liked 'grandmother mind'and becoming friend with myself  
                    and I thought it is what I need sometimes.
                </p>
                <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
                <p>
                    It was surprising that meditation even speeds up people's skin recovery. 
                </p>
