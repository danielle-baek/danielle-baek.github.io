                <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
                <p>
                    I think it is good to be a listener, but I found it hard to be. Especially these days,
                    when I meet my friends because I have so many things that I want to tell, I was not a good listener.
                    In this chapter, it explains that I need to do mindfulness listening for others as a gift, and 
                    I also found it helpful to understand myself that I want talk a lot because I have so many 
                    distractions in my mind. I haven't tried it with other person yet, but I thought it is a useful skill
                    which can make everyone happy. 
                </p>
                <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
                <p>
                   The three techniques were: Have a buddy, Do less than you can, and Take one breath a day. 
                   I will try all of them. I have a friend who already likes the meditation and she might share the 
                   experience with me. Doing less sounds easy, and taking one breath sounds easy as well. I just need 
                   to try to not forget everyday. 
                </p>
                <h3> Any other musings?</h3>
                <p>
                    I liked walking meditation too. I like waking because it's relaxing and making it easy to organise 
                    my thoughts. It will be better with meditation.
