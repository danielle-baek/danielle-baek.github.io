                <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my friend I met at uni is a very friendly and nice guy. He is compassionate 
                    to every people he meets, and also a hard worker himself. When there's a group 
                    project or assignment, he always lead the group and help and encouraged other 
                    members. Even when someone annoys him, he doesn't hate or get angry at the person.
                     Everyone likes him. And because he made a good relations with people 
                      when he had internship, he could get his job at a big company even before he 
                      graduated.
                </p>

                <h3>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
                <p>
                    I think it calmed down my mind and gave me positive feeling.
                    But it was not a very big difference. 
                </p>

                <h3>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
                <p>
                    It was hard. I just felt I'm not a good person enough to receive negative things 
                    and transform it to good things. Maybe I need more practice.
                </p>

                <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? 
                    How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
                <p>
                    SCARF model stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness
                    which are 5 important domains for social experience. In Phase 0, status can 
                    be lower or higher when someone else did more/less work than me. For autonomy, I felt 
                    that I don't want to do when I needed to make calculator from the beginning. 
                    It was not stress from working on it, but the helplessness that I felt because 
                    it was bigger and more complicate work. I think the Relatedness 
                    and Fairness will matter more in bootcamp, when working on project with other people. 
                    
                </p>

                <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, 
                    but can take practice to develop!)</h3>
                <p>
                    I haven't tried difficult conversation but I agree with that it's a valuable skill because I find 
                    myself having a hard time for difficult conversation. I even experience emotionally 
                    overwhelmed and I don't know why. I think this technique can help me with it. 
                    I will definitely try when I have something to talk about with someone.
