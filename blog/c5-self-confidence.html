                <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
                <p>
                    According to Daniel Goleman, self-awareness is 
                    knowing one's internal states, preferences, resources and intuitions. And
                    he also said 'Self-awareness... is a neutral mode that maintains 
                    self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions.', which is very 
                    similar to what Jon Kabat-Zinn defined mindfulness:'Mindfulness means paying
                    attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-
                    judgementally.' As they are pretty much same thing, training for mindfulness 
                    will enhance self-awareness too, which can help improving self-confidence.
                </p>
                <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, 
                    Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
                <p>
                    I actually try body scan sometimes before I go to sleep, especially when I 
                    have too many thoughts or somehow I can't fall asleep. I learned it from 
                    yoga teacher but I think it's very similar to what this book explains.
                    It relaxes my body and get me easy to fall asleep as it explains in the book.
                    I haven't tried journaling
                </p>
                <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
                <p>                    
                    At first time, it was hard to understand, but I feel that strong emotions like 
                    anger or sadness control myself sometimes. I should always try to remember 
                    that the feelings are just what I experience, not myself. The metaphor that 
                    thoughts and emotions are like clouds made it easy to understand.
