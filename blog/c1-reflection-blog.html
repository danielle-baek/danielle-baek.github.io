                <h4>Reflection after watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video</h4>
            </div>

              <h3>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h3>    
              <p>
                I want to learn lots of web development skills and project skills 
                in team-based environment.      
              </p>
          
              <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>    
              <p>
                In the video, Shereef said about people's attitude in the restaurant 
                and the kitchen to explain creator's mindset. I noticed that I was more
                like people in the restaurant who are just waiting for someone to help me. 
                I should think more actively and get involved to create my own website and 
                software in order to be a better software developer.      
              </p>
          
              <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>    
              <p>
                This culture is different from what I had until now and it might
                be hard for me to understand and follow the new culture. But I think it 
                is a great way to work in team and to express myself to be a good creator.
              </p>
          
              <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>    
              <p>
                 Little bit. I expected EDA as just a web development course but I found 
                 that they help people in their habit and communication way as well, which is 
                 important too.  
              </p>
          
              <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? 
                Does it make you nervous?</h3>    
              <p>
                 Yes. But to be honest, I think I am more nervous than excited. I easily 
                 get worried when starting new things and meeting new people. But I am 
                 excited when I think about myself being changed after completing this 
                 course.
