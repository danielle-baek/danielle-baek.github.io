    <h2>Reflection after watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video</h2>
    <h3>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h3>    
    <p>
      I want to learn lots of web development skills and project skills 
      in team-based environment.      
    </p>

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>    
    <p>
      In the video, Shereef said about people's attitude in the restaurant 
      and the kitchen to explain creator's mindset. I noticed that I was more
      like people in the restaurant who are just waiting for someone to help me. 
      I should think more actively and get involved to create my own website and 
      software in order to be a better software developer.      
    </p>

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>    
    <p>
      This culture is different from what I had until now and it might
      be hard for me to understand and follow the new culture. But I think it 
      is a great way to work in team and to express myself to be a good creator.
    </p>

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>    
    <p>
       Little bit. I expected EDA as just a web development course but I found 
       that they help people in their habit and communication way as well, which is 
       important too.  
    </p>

    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? 
      Does it make you nervous?</h3>    
    <p>
       Yes. But to be honest, I think I am more nervous than excited. I easily 
       get worried when starting new things and meeting new people. But I am 
       excited when I think about myself being changed after completing this 
       course.
