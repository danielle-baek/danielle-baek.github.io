                    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
                    <p>Grid based design is a design of webpage with layout using pre-made grid classes. '.row' class 
                        is just one row of 100% of width of the page, and there are 12 '.column' classes with width 
                        of 1/12 to 12/12. 12 columns can useful to divide the page into 2, 3, or 4 which is very handy 
                        when making layout with different sized boxes.</p>
                    <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
                    <p>When a webpage is responsive, the contents in the page changes size depend on the screen size.
                        Hence, the website can be opened with different kinds of devices like tablet PC or smart phone
                        without any problem.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
                    <p>HTML has many semantic tags such as header, paragraph, division, etc. and they provide information
                        about the each content on the page. For example, h1, h2, h3 are all heading tags but h1 is larger
                        heading than h2 and h2 is larger heading than h3. The web browser understands it and shows 
                        different font size automatically. Semantic tags are communication between the code and the website. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
                    <p>I didn't know there would be a website like for place holder. It's sad that dog one is not working
                        but kitten is cute too :) Google font and Bootstrap will be useful too.
