                <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust
                     and sincerity? How did it go?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I couldn't find this part from the chapter.. 
                </p>

                <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
                <p>
                    I thought it is pretty much same as mindful listening technique. I haven't 
                    tried empathic listening but  I tried to do informal mindful listening when I met
                     my friend before. However, it didn't work well. As I focused on listening and 
                    didn't talk or ask questions much about it, she felt that her story is not 
                    interesting enough and stopped. I thought it was not very practical, or I am
                     not skillful enough or something... 
                </p>

                <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
                <p>
                    I think it's a good technique to enhance empathy and understand others. 
                    People sometimes don't like others because they have different personalities,
                     religion, or ethnicity. But it is important to aware that they are people who can 
                     think, feel and suffer like myself. 
                </p>

                <h3>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h3>
                <p>
                    When I was working at a cafe, There was other staff called M, and I didn't like her
                    because she just wants to do coffee, but doesn't like doing other thing like cleaning 
                    table, or washing dishes. 
                    My point of view: It's normally busy at cafe, and there's always something to do like
                    even if there are not many customers. But she just stands next to coffee machine 
                    and if there's no coffee to make, she wipes bench again and again. Also other staffs 
                    want to make coffee too because it is the most fun job but she always try to take over. 
                    Everyone didn't like her doing it.
                    Her point of view: She wants to make coffee because she know how to make and she likes 
                    it. She has a good talking skill with customers as well. Maybe she thinks other jobs 
                    are not very important.                   

                </p>

                <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
                <p>
                    I agree with that empathy and kindness is important to get close to others, and that 
                    being nice to other people is helpful to myself in many ways. I sometimes feel that 
                    socialising with people is very stressful but when I see someone who's very friendly 
                    and nice to everyone, I want to be close to him/her too.
