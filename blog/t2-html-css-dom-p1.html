            <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? 
                How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
                <p>HTML and CSS are languages that we need in order to build website.
                    HTML contains the contents of the page such as title, text, images, 
                    links, etc. CSS does design of the website like layout, colours,
                    sizes, etc. And DOM understand the languages and represents it on 
                    the webpage. </p>
            <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
                <p>Everything in a webpage is box. Boxifying design means when designing 
                    webpage, we need to draw boxes on every elements.
                </p>
            <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
                <p>The box model is used when designing CSS layouts which contains 4 boxes:
                     margin(outside), border, padding and content(inside). Every HTML element 
                     has box model and it's easy to manage them by coding on css. 
                     (e.g. margin:20px;)
