            <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
            <p>
                The Emotional Intelligence(EQ) is ability to understand and manage feelings and
                emotions. There are 5 domains: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy,
                and social skills. It is scientifically proved that optimist has better work 
                performance and leadership and it's also related to happiness. Anyone can improve 
                emotional intelligence by training.

            <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>
                I think the two minutes of mindfulness is good training for the emotional 
                intelligence. I heard that meditation is really good to controlling emotions and 
                enhance concentration from other people as well but sometimes it's hard to make time
                or remember to do everyday. For that reason, I think two minutes of mindfulness 
                is short and easy way to make happiness and optimize myself. 
                I tried few times before studying, and I found it easy and it helped me to manage
                my feelings so I could focus better.
