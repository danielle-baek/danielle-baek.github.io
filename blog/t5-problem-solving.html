                <h3>1. Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
                <p>
                    If it's a simple problem, it was usually small mistake such as typo, brackets, etc..
                    When it happened I quickly skimed the code to find out, and if it's 
                    hard to find, I read it more carefully. 
                    At the first time, I wondered why it is not working, and started panicking when I couldn't
                    figure out. When I solve the problem, I feel happy. As it keeps happening I got used to 
                    checking the small problems and I try hard to not make small mistake when I code.

                </p>

                <h3>2. Solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
                <p>
                    The hardest problems about Javascript I have met were the questions fromm 'Free Code Camp'. 
                    I remember the Music album Questions were quite difficult. 
                    I failed many times and every time I fail I changed code little bit.
                    I tried to understand the question well. 
                    It was little bit stressful when I failed, but it was fun at the same time because 
                    I felt like I'm doing puzzle, solving little bit at a time and I could finish it eventually.

                </p>

                <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h3>
                <p>                    
                    - Pseudocode : I think pseudocode before I write code
                    - Trying something : I do this everytime
                    - Rubber ducky method : I never had rubber ducky.. 
                    - Reading error messages : I try to understand error messages
                    - Console.logging: sometimes?
                    - Googling : very useful when I know what I'm doing
                    - Asking your peers for help : I ask my friends but they get annoyed sometimes
                    - Asking coaches for help : I get scared sometimes
                    - Improving your process with reflection : It's good when I repeat same mistakes.
