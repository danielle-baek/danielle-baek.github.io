                <h3>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h3>
                <p>
                    A responsive site means the contents in the webpage are flexible in size
                    depending on the screen size. contents like texts and images become smaller
                    in small screen and become bigger in large screen. 
                    It is important to have responsive site because these days, people access 
                    internet with many different electronic devices from desktop to mobile phone.
                </p>
                <h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h3>
                <p>
                    Mobile first design is designing of mobile screen webpage first, and then 
                    larger screen sizes. Now people use their smart phone more often to access 
                    website. Also mobile phone screen is the smallest screen so it is easy to 
                    design to show contents and they can go into certain layout for bigger screens.
                </p>
                <h3>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h3>
                <p>
                    Framework is a basic structure of the website that is already made and can be 
                    provided for any other designs. It makes building the website easier and faster 
                    than doing it from the scratch. However, using the framework without understanding
                    it might not help improving the programming skills.
                </p>
                <h3>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h3>
                <p>
                    Wireframe is used when planning for webpage layout. 
                    It can be simple drawing of the boxes of different contents.
                    We need wireframe to explain and represent the design before we make it.
                </p>

                <h3> The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</h3>
                <p>
                    I found it difficult when I tried to make mobile screen to desktop screen 
                    because I was not sure if the contents and the layout on mobile screen will fit 
                    to desktop screen and changing it to make a good desktop screen layout without 
                    changing too much.
